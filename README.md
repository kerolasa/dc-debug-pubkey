## Domain Connect Debug Public Keys

This tool aims to help Domain Connect service providers to debug syncPubKeyDomain
setup.  Typical usage should look something like below.

```
go install github.com/kerolasa/dc-debug-pubkey@latest
$GOPATH/dc-debug-pubkey --help
Usage: ./dc-debug-pubkey ./service-provider.template.json ./private_key.pem raw-POST-data
       ./dc-debug-pubkey --postdata ./data.json ./service-provider.template.json
  -key string
        host prefix in syncPubKeyDomain, when empty the domain is queried
  -loglevel string
        loglevel can be one of: panic fatal error warn info debug trace (default "info")
  -postdata string
        path to POST data json (omits need to have private key)

```

The private key is generated by the service provider.  See exampleservice
link for instructions how to do that.  The
[template](https://github.com/Domain-Connect/Templates/blob/master/exampleservice.domainconnect.org.template1.json)
is the data service provider gives to DNS Providers to, and has information
what TXT record the DNS Providers need to use to verify updates.
